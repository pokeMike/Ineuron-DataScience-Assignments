        "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of another class.\n",
        "- It enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes. - Inheritance is used to establish relationships between classes, where a derived class (also called a subclass or child class) inherits characteristics from a base class (also called a superclass or parent class).\n",
        "- The derived class can extend or modify the functionality inherited from the base class, while still retaining the ability to access its properties and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is used for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code reuse:** Inheritance allows classes to inherit and reuse code from existing classes, reducing redundancy and promoting efficient development.\n",
        "- **Modularity and organization:** Inheritance enables the structuring of classes in a hierarchical manner, grouping related classes under a common base class.\n",
        "- **Polymorphism:** Inheritance forms the basis for polymorphism, allowing objects of derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class, which leads to more flexible and extensible code."

        "### Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Single inheritance and multiple inheritance are two types of inheritance relationships between classes:\n",
        "- Single inheritance:\n",
        "  - Single inheritance refers to the scenario where a derived class inherits from a single base class.\n",
        "  - In other words, the derived class has only one parent class. This relationship forms a linear hierarchy.\n",
        "  - Single inheritance promotes simplicity and avoids complexity in the class structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance:\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance refers to the scenario where a derived class inherits from multiple base classes. In this case, the derived class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes.\n",
        "  - This relationship allows the derived class to combine characteristics from different base classes, enabling greater code reuse and flexibility.\n",
        "  - However, multiple inheritance can introduce complexity and potential conflicts, such as the diamond problem (when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Single inheritance:** Promotes simplicity and a clear hierarchy, making it easier to understand and maintain the code. It can be sufficient for many scenarios and avoids the potential complications of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "  - **Multiple inheritance:** Enables greater code reuse by inheriting from multiple base classes. It allows for combining the functionality of different classes and promoting more modular and flexible designs."

        "- The `\"protected\"` access modifier in inheritance allows the attributes and methods of a class to be accessed by its derived classes.\n",
        "- It provides a middle ground between \"private\" and \"public\" access modifiers. - Protected members can be accessed within the class that defines them and any derived classes.\n",
        "- The significance of the \"protected\" access modifier is to provide encapsulation and controlled access within the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "- It allows derived classes to access and modify inherited members, while still restricting access to other classes or objects outside the inheritance hierarchy.\n",

        "- It provides a way to access and invoke the base class's methods and constructors.\n",
        "- The `\"super\"` keyword is primarily used when the derived class wants to extend or modify the behavior of the base class while still utilizing the base class's implementation.\n",
        "- The `\"super\"` keyword is typically used in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. **Accessing base class methods:** The `\"super\"` keyword can be used to call a method from the base class that has been overridden in the derived class. This allows the derived class to extend the base class's behavior while still leveraging the existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. **Calling the base class constructor:** The `\"super\"` keyword is used to call the base class constructor from within the derived class's constructor. This allows the derived class to initialize the inherited attributes from the base class and perform any additional initialization specific to the derived class.\n",
