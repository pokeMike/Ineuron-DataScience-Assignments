    "#### 2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "**Ans:**    1. String: A string is a data type used to represent a sequence of characters, such as letters, digits, or symbols. It is typically used to store and manipulate textual data. In many programming languages, strings are enclosed within quotation marks (single or double). For example, \"Hello, World!\" is a string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Variable: A variable is a named storage location in a program that can hold a value. It serves as a container for storing and retrieving data during program execution. Variables have a name, a type, and a value. The value assigned to a variable can change during the execution of a program. Variables are used to store different types of data, including strings, numbers, and other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a string is a specific type of data representing a sequence of characters, while a variable is a named storage location that can hold different types of data, including strings. A variable can be assigned a string value, among other possible values, depending on its declared type."

    "#### 3. Describe three different Data Types ?\n",

    "2. **float data type**: We can use float data type to represent floating point values (decimal values)\n",
    "3. **complex data type**: Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. "

    "#### 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "**Ans:** An expressions are constructed from variables, literals, constants, function calls, and operators. They perform computations and produce values that can be utilized for various purposes within a Python program. If we ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result."

    "**Ans:** In the given code, bacon is initially assigned the value 22. Then, the expression bacon + 1 is evaluated, which adds 1 to the value of bacon. However, the result of the expression is not stored or assigned to any variable. Therefore, the value of bacon remains unchanged, and it still holds the original value of **22**.
